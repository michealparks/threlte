Implements the Outline postprocessing pass. [Vanilla threejs example here](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=outline#webgl_postprocessing_outline)

An outlined cube loops through a maze, with a different outline color when the object is hidden.

<Example path="postprocessing/outline" />

### How it works

- in `Scene.svelte`
  - bind the mesh we want to outline, and pass it as prop `selectedMesh` to `CustomRenderer` component
- Postprocessing is performed within `CustomRenderer` component
  - we use 'postprocessing' library from the pmndrs team
  - call `EffectComposer` on threlte's `render` function, to return a new `render` function
  - then run our own render loop with this new render function, using `useRender` from threlte
  - our function `setupEffectComposer` adds the required RenderPass, and OutlinePass to the composer, specifically to our mesh
  - this function will re-run if `selectedMesh` changes (not done in this example currently)
- animation of the cube is done with `svelte/motion` in `Scene.svelte`
